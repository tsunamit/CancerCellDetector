* distances are calculated via opencv coordinates, likely tied to pixel count
	-> conversion must be done between real world coordinates (nanometers etc..) to
	coordinates in order to maintain consistency. 
	-> should be a simple ratio calculation


/// Tasks ///
* Multiple file features
* Database/csv/xlsx export features
	-> need ui

/// Data Needed ///
* image files to write
* off body centroid count
* off body centroid individual distance values


/// Would be nice to.... ///
* labeling system to graphically show which centroid corresponds to which one
